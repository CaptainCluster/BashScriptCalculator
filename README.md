# BashScriptCalculator
A short, and simple, Bash Script calculator that can perform simple calculations. Made by me as part of the "Basics of Linux" course at LUT University.

The program is capable of calculating additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, power calculations and remainder calculations. 
Here are the symbols for the operators...

+   ===> addition
-   ===> subtraction
x   ===> multiplication
/   ===> division
^   ===> power calculation
%   ===> remainder calculation

NOTE! The calculations only work between two numbers. The program can't handle calculations between, for instance, three or more numbers.
You need to use precisely three arguments and they have to be separated with a space. Should they have no spaces between, the program will
think you gave one argument which you technically did. 

Here is an example of me doing a division calculation using the program.
